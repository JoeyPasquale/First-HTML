        <p>My first ever high school soccer game just occured. Yes, we did <strong> lose </strong> 3-1. But I think we did pretty good. Bernards was a very skillful team. I play side-d and I think I did pretty good. On the last goal I didn't get to the man in time on a counter. During warm-ups I got stung by a bee and it hurt the whole game. Hopefully we can get Bernards back next time we play them.</p>

        <p>On this day, we played Bernards again.<strong> Best game we've ever played, best game I've ever played.</strong> But we still lost 3-2. It doesn't matter, though. We are improving as a team, and I think the rest of our season is going to be pretty good. Especially because we are getting our injured players back. </p>
